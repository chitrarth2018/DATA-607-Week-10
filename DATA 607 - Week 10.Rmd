# having read most of the plays selected for the analysis - the sentiment scores evolution doesnt tie up well with my perception for few of the plays. For example, plays such as 'A Midsummer Night's Dream', 'As you like it', 'Much Ado about Nothing' are well accepted comedies. However as per the sentiment score evolution, the scores are mostly seen in the negative zone. Even for plays like 'Merchant of Venice' and 'The Tempest' - they all have a happy ending and such negative scores are not expected

# There is a signficant change in the sentiment evolution scores for plays such as 'A Midsummer Night's Dream', 'As you like it', 'Much Ado about Nothing' which are well accepted comedies. The sentiments are now in the net positive domain which is in line with the nature of these plays. Point to be noticed here is Macbeth - a world renowned tragedy tends to maintain a sombre sentiment throughout the play with extreme negative emotions seen towards the end of the novel.
